Hi! This is Saad Shakeel

A Digital Stop Watch
It has 4 functionalities done by 4 buttons 
To Start, Pause, Reset and Tracking plus Displaying the Lap time.
To have a good user experience I have added some effects on the button like when it is hovered over the color changes plus there is neon effect on the buttons
When the button is clicked it has effect of pressing which shows that button is clicked 
The Functionalites of the button and the logic behind it is done by using JavaScript.

I learned Pretty good while making this project
